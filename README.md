## Features

An extremely simplistic extension that just adds some parentheses unto Classes and method invocations.

## Requirements

None

## Extension Settings

TBD `contributes.configuration` 

## Known Issues

* Doesn't ACTUALLY search for methods, so if the word just happens to be capitalized it'll trigger
* Might not work with other extensions
* Triggers for CLASSES

## Todo

* Add `toggle` for `semicolon`
* IMPORTANT - Rework the logic from scratch

## Release Notes

### 1.0.0

Initial release of CSharp_AutoParenthesis_Extension
